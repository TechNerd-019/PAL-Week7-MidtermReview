	// 
	//Car struct detailing information for a car (Owner, Car Brand, Model Number (int), and Number of Kilometers (float))
	struct car

	//Question: what is the difference between car and car2?

	int main()

		//How do we access the struct? (Hard-code entire struct versus user input of just one variable in the struct)

		//Hard Code Example
		struct car myCar = { .carOwner = "Hayden", .carBrand = "Dodge", .modelNumber = 1, .kilometresCounter = 420.69 };

		/*
		//User Input Example
		printf("Please enter the name of the Car Owner: ");
		scanf_s("%s", myCar.carOwner, MAX_LEN);
		*/

		/*
		//Initialize individual components Example
		char newModel[] = "Honda";
		//myCar.carBrand = newModel; //Can't do this why?
		strncpy_s(myCar.carBrand, MAX_LEN, newModel, MAX_LEN);
		*/

		//Print the contents of the struct
		printf("\n-----------------------------\n");
		printf("Owner: %s \n", myCar.carOwner);
		printf("Brand: %s \n", myCar.carBrand);
		printf("Model Number: %d \n", myCar.modelNumber);
		printf("Kilometres: %.2f ", myCar.kilometresCounter);

		//Part 2 - Let's use the typedef of the struct!

		CAR myCar2;
